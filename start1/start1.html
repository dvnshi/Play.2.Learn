            The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 inserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may, by law, determine.

<br>
 <p>
"Imagine there's a rule or law that says every child between the ages of six and fourteen has the right to go to school for free, and they must go to school. This means that no matter who you are or where you live, you can go to school, and your parents don't have to pay for it. It's like saying that going to school is very important, and every child should have the chance to learn and go to school, just like you!"
In simple terms, it's a rule that guarantees that all kids from six to fourteen can go to school for free, and it's really important because education is important for everyone.</p>
